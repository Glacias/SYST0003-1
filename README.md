# Automated glucose regulation system.
Project realized as part of the "Linear Control System" course given by Guillaume Drion to graduate computer engineering students at the University of Li√®ge during the academic year 2019-2020.

# Context
The goal of this project was to create a system regulating the blood sugar concentration for people affected by type 1 diabetes. These people have their pancreas that does not produceany insulin such that they need to inject themselves what they need. Our linear control system would do it by itself, using an insulin pump, and hopefully substitute what the pancreas does for a non-diabetic person.
